Red-Light-Green-Light esque 3D VR Game for Meta Quest 2 created for Intro to 2D Game Development

## Premise
Inspired by "Squid Game", we decided to challenge ourselves by building a 3D VR game that while completing multiple levels of actions, an "omniscient" sound will randomly play, which the player would have to freeze or be eliminated. 

## Features
1. 3 separate levels (tutorial level included), with increasing difficulty
2. Different environments for different levels
3. Using your controller as a hand to manipulate objects in-game
4. Omniscience playing sounds at random times, in which the player has to stop or otherwise be eliminated.

## This Project Showcases: 
- 🎮 VR Game Development with Unity VR, C# and Meta Quest 2
- 🏃‍♂️ Agile development with teammates

## My Contributions 
- I was responsible for the main player controller (hand movement, tracking, manipulating objects, etc.), as well as the tutorial level that teaches the player how to grab and manipulate objects

## To Improve for V2
- [ ] Add additional levels with increasing difficulty
